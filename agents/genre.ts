      "Player onboarding must manage cross-genre learning curves.",
      "Mechanic synergy matters more than novelty alone.",
      "Tonal consistency across genre elements keeps immersion intact.",
      "Unexpected genre pairings can create breakout experiences when balanced well.",
      "Use metaphor or narrative to justify genre transitions (e.g., puzzle = mental space, combat = physical space).",
      "Design systems that transform based on player input to reflect genre shifts (e.g., rhythm inputs affecting battle flow).",
      "Encourage genre blending at different layers: mechanics, theme, UI, and progression.",
      "Test fusion ideas with small prototypes to explore emergent depth early.",
      "Player agency is key—allow genre mechanics to influence one another dynamically.",
      "Use procedural generation to balance structured mechanics with emergent genre overlap.",
      "Create hybrid economies or progression paths to bridge genre expectations (e.g., XP from puzzles fuels deck-building).",
      "Cross-genre design can appeal to broader audiences if the fusion respects accessibility and thematic harmony.",
      "Embrace genre inversion—turn core mechanics of one genre into subversions within another.",
      "UI and feedback must clearly communicate genre context to prevent cognitive overload.",
      "Think in terms of tension vs. release between genre mechanics (e.g., slow puzzle solving between intense roguelike runs).",
      "Leverage musicality, color, or pacing to tie disparate genre beats into a unified rhythm.",
      "Genre fusion isn’t just about combining—it’s about evolving genres into something new and expressive.",
